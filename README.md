# TopScore Technical Test

This is a full-stack solution for a sentence validation and word scoring system. It was built to demonstrate clean architecture, robust validation, user feedback, and production-readiness (within scope). The project includes an ASP.NET Core Web API backend and an Angular frontend.

---

## Project Overview

Users submit a sentence, and the application extracts and stores the longest valid word based on a strict set of rules. The UI provides instant feedback, and a searchable, sortable, paginated table allows review of saved entries.

## Technologies Used

| Layer        | Tech Stack                                      |
|--------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Frontend     | Angular 17, SCSS, TypeScript                    |
| Backend      | ASP.NET Core 9.0, Entity Framework Core (SQLite) |
| Logging      | Serilog (console and daily log files)           |
| Database     | SQLite                                          |
| Dev Tools    | Swagger, Visual Studio 2022, vscode (optional) |

---

## Architecture Summary

- **Backend** is cleanly structured into `Core`, `Data`, and `Api` projects.
- **Frontend** uses Angular standalone components with SSR support.
- Validation rules are separated into extensions and constants for reuse.
- Logging is configured using Serilog and persisted to `Logs/log-<date>.txt`.
- API is RESTful and fully tested.

---

## Setup Instructions

> Prerequisites: .NET 9 SDK+, Node.js 18+, Visual Studio 2022, Angular CLI

### Backend (API)
1. Open solution in **Visual Studio 2022**
2. Set `TopScore.Api` as **startup project**
3. Run the API (F5 or `dotnet run` from `TopScore.Api`)
4. Swagger is available at `http://localhost:5210/swagger`

### Frontend (Angular)
1. Open terminal in `top-score-ui/`
2. Run: `npm install`
3. Start app: `npx serve dist/top-score-ui/browser` (after build)
4. Or develop live: `ng serve`

> Ensure backend is running first before submitting from the frontend.

## Key Features

- Sentence validation based on strict rules
- Saves longest valid, unique word per sentence
- Search, sort, and pagination in frontend
- Submit feedback messages with saved word
- Full logging of all requests and validations
- Swagger support for API documentation

---

## Validation Rules

A word is considered **valid** if it:

- Is at least 8 characters long
- Contains at least **one uppercase** letter
- Contains at least **one lowercase** letter
- Contains at least **one digit**
- Has **no repeating characters**
- Contains **only letters and digits** (no punctuation)

The sentence itself must also be **no longer than 500 characters**.

## API Endpoints

| Method | Route            | Description                              |
|--------|------------------|------------------------------------------|
| POST   | `/api/words`     | Submits a sentence and stores valid word |
| GET    | `/api/words`     | Retrieves paginated list of saved words  |
| DELETE | `/api/words`     | Clears all words (via Swagger only)      |

---

## Developer Convenience Endpoint

The /api/words [DELETE] endpoint exists as a convenience method during development and testing. While not required in the spec, it allowed for quickly resetting the dataset while validating scenarios.

In a real production environment, this endpoint would either:

- Be removed entirely, or
- Be secured behind authentication and authorization controls.

It is intentionally excluded from the frontend UI.

## Design Notes

- Trailing punctuation **is not** stripped; words with it will fail validation.
- A max sentence length of 500 characters ensures performance and simplicity.
- Logging is written to `Logs/` daily and includes all errors and accepted/rejected words.
